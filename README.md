• A website contains a menu bar on top. On the home page, we can see random photos. We can click on each item in the menu to navigate to the page we want to see. Each item is a topic, whatever you want. Eg: flowers, buildings, sports…etc.

• We provided the API above. You can access the document page to read details and use it to fetch photos.

Plus points:

• Make a search item on the menu bar.
    ◦ We have a search input on the search page, and the user can type anything to search for photos.
• Lazy load for each page.
• Skeleton for loading.
